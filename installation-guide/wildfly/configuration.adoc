= WildFly & EAP Configuration

== Configuration Properties

All of the apiman WARs share a common configuration file called *apiman.properties*, which can be found in *standalone/configuration*.
This file therefore contains configuration settings for all three applications (API Manager, API Manager UI, API Gateway).

Please refer to the apiman.properties file itself, as well as this document, for more information on each property's purpose and possible values.
