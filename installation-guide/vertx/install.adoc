= Apiman Vert.x Gateway

The apiman Vert.x gateway is our premiere offering and should offer the best performance characteristics of any of platforms.

This implementation is the apiman gateway only, and is normally paired with the servlet version (e.g. WildFly, EAP, Jetty, etc) - although, it can be run headless for specific workloads.
